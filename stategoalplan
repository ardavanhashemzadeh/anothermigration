CurrentState:
5 NAS units running mariaDB10           pedo
1 Windows server running MySQL 5.5.14   ortho
2 Windows VM running MySQL 5.5.14       cr,(nt, training)

1 Linux replication slave running MariaDB - Currently replicating main pedo DBs from nas

1 Linux VM running MariaDB 10 - Currently replicanting main pedo dbs from replication slave

additional dbs:
jhds: CEMT
ssds: EMQ
dbbackup: test merge

Goal:
Cut out middle man linux replication slave, have azure instance replicate directly from the sources
Setup master-master replication between cloud db server and on prem dbs, use cloud db server as source for nt, cr, training and others

Ensure all dbs (CEMT, EMQ, SSortho, and Naptime) are replicated in cloud and on prem

Plan:
